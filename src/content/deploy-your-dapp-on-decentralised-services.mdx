## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will be learning how to deploy a dapp built using celo composer on a decentalised cloud service called spheron protocol.

## Prerequisites​

To start building, you’ll need a basic understanding of web development, Node (v12), yarn, and Git.

- [Node (v12)](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Celo Composer

The easiest way to get started with Celo Composer is using `@celo/celo-composer`
. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building dApps on Celo for multiple frameworks including React, React Native (w/o Expo), Flutter, and Angular. You can create the dApp using the default Composer templates provided by Celo. In our case, we will work with react, specifically NextJS. The stack included in celo composer:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Celo](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) Smart contract development environment

## Spheron Protocol

[Spheron Protocol](https://spheron.network/) is an all-in-one decentralized platform for automating modern dapps.

They provide a frictionless developer experience to take care of the hard things: deploying instantly, scaling automatically, and serving personalized content on decentralized networks.

Let's start building:

## Getting Started

1. Bootstrap the application using this Celo Composer command.

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer create
```

2. Select *React* framework(NextJS)

/>


3. Select *react-celo* as the web3 library
